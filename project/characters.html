								Eren Jaeger is the protagonist of the series. He is a teenager who swears revenge on enormous creatures known as Titans that devoured his mother and destroyed his town in the Shiganshina district in Wall Maria. In order to defeat the Titans, Eren enlists in the Military and joins the Survey Corps—an elite group of soldiers who fight Titans outside the walls and also study the physiology of Titans in order to know what they are fighting. As the story progresses, Eren gains the power of becoming a Titan later identified as "Attack Titan". <br><br>
								Eren is best described as hardheaded, strong-willed, passionate, and impulsive, which are attributes of both his strong determination to protect mankind and eventually escape the Walls. As a young child, he was so intent on joining the Scout Regiment that he argued with and shouted at his mother, referring to the people in the village as "silly" and compared them to complacent livestock.<br><br>
								Eren deeply cares about his family and friends, however the strongest trait of his is his combative and reckless spirit, always seeking for freedom and for change. He always charge, it doesn't matter if he is in a big disavantage or not. He also has a strong sense of justice and a unbelievable will power, even though it is not unusual for him to let his anger take over in a emotional memoent. He is probably the character that will develop the most thoughout the show, becoming a complete different person than on the beginning of it.

								Armin had a deep fascination with the world beyond the Walls. As a child, he found and studied an illegal book about the outside world that was owned by his grandfather, and share with Eren, his best friend. He had to deal with a lot of bullying when he was a kid. Having rely on his friends Eren and Mikasa to protect him along with his frail physique, leadi him to have poor self-esteem and to believe that he was a burden to others. Because of this, Armin has always been very eager to prove his worth.<br><br>
								As a child, he hoped that one day he would be able to consider himself a true equal to his friends. But the truth is that regardless his physical weakness, he proved his value over and over again, as a refugee and on the military. He is extremely inteligent, rational and analytical, what makes his help to his friends and to the troops ro deal with the most difficult and hopeless challenges they have to face.<br><br>
								His reason for joing the Survey Corps (one pf the the military banches) because he wanted to make a differentce, and also to fulfill his dream of getting see the outside word. One thing that really motivates him is to one day being able to see the occean.

								Mikasa Ackerman had a tough life since her early days. Her biological parents were murdered by bandits, and then was kidnapped by them. The bandits were planning to sell her as an exotic sexual slave since she was the last asian girl in the world. Fortunately, she was saved by Eren, who, even being just a kid, managed to kill two of the bandits. After this extremely traumatic event, Mikasa develop a really sudden and mysterious strength. Due to this trauma, Mikasa also gained a generally cynical view of life and accepted the world as a cruel place where only those who are strong are able to survive.<br><br>
								After becoming an orphan, Eren's parents adopted Mikasa, and she was raised as part of the Yeagar family for a while, becoming really fond and even protective towards Eren, and also she became frinds with Armin. She used her mysteriously acquired fighting skills to protect Eren and Armin as kids.<br><br>
								After Losing her new home and her new family when the Wall Maria was breached by the titans, she followed Eren into the military and into the survey corps. She joined the military mainly to try protecting Eren, nevertheless her special abilities made of her one of the best soldiers in the war against the titans. Mikasa's bond with Eren is undoubtedly her most important relationship that defines Mikasa. Because of Eren, Mikasa expressed a variety of emotions such as compassion, worry, anger, shame, sadness, and tenderness. She will do whatever it takes to prevent her to lose the only and last remainder family she has left.

								The Colossal Titan serves as the primary antagonist of the first three seasons of Attack on Titan series. This Titan is notable for its massive size and significant control over the steam emitted by its Titan body along with the user's control over the power of the blast released by its transformation, creating a powerful explosion everytime he shows up. But for sure, its most remarking characteristic is infamous for its incredible size, standing at a previously unseen 200 feet, high enough to peer over the top of the Walls.
								Also, another thing both it and the Armoured Titan stand out, is that they, differently from the other titans, seem to be intelligent, using strategy instead of just the usual titans devouring instincs. <br><br>
								Its body mass gives it overwhelming physical strength but to compensate this, its immense size makes its movements very slow. It is strong enough to destroy the outer gate of Wall Maria with a single kick, launch entire houses in the air, and send Eren's Attack Titan flying from the ground to the top of Wall Maria.
								It is to be noted that the arms are massively disproportionate in size to the rest of the body, likely resulting in less strength than the legs. Its slowness makes it harder fight and smash when his targets are experienced military soldiers on Omni-Directional Mobility (ODM) gear, but its control of emission of heat makes it almost impossible to someone manage getting close enough to kill it.<br><br>
								Even though its slowness affects its performance when trying to smash soldiers in a combat, its power of destruction is catastrophic, since its heat explosion, if used used at its max power, can wipe out a intire town, and it can physically destroy and trample any building or contructions. The simple action  it of walking is enough to cause a medium-scale earthquake in the surrounding areas.
								The Colossal Titan first appeared in the year 845 during the fall of Wall Maria and later re-emerged in 850 at Trost District.

								Just like the Colossal Titan, the Armoured Titan is intelligent. It might not nearly as big as the Colossal, but it doesn't mean it is small. It is 50 feet tall, which is quite big to an average titan. Besides that, its entire body is covered by armoured plates, and having them as its skin on most of the body, inluding all the parts that are vital to a titan. Therefore, it is nearly impossible to defeat it, since even cannons shells rebound on him like a volleyball. It is even more helpless for a soldier who is only equipped with the ODM and the swords. <br><br>
								Because of this heavy armour, it tends to be a slower than an average titan, but even though it can only maintain moderate running speeds, its combat agility still is very deadly to troopers. Also, one perk of being so heavy is its enertia once it starts running, it runs over everything on its way, just like a freight train going at full speed, it is unstoppable. By using his enertia, it was able to break the second gate of the Maria Wall on Eren's hometown. <br><br>
								It is a really powerful titan. Even though its destruction scale is far smaller than the Colossal's, its power on direct combat is extreme. Humanity will have to develop a way of surviving and resistig those intelligent titans advances, since no barrier, no blade and no projectile they have is capable of stopping it.
