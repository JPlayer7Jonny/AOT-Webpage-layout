						Attack on Titan Season 4 Part 2 is approaching its final episodes, and things are heating up as the anime’s main characters attempt to stop the Rumbling. Episode 85 sees the alliance fighting the Jaegerists in the hopes of catching up to Eren before he does the unthinkable. And Attack on Titan Episode 86 will likely determine if they succeed in that endeavor — but what is its release date and time, and where can fans watch it? <br><br>
						New episodes of Attack on Titan Season 4 Part 2 stream every Sunday. Barring any unexpected delays, the next installment will stick to that schedule. Attack on Titan Episode 86 drops on March 20, bringing fans one step closer to this outing’s conclusion (though we should note that the finale will be delayed by one week, arriving on April 3).
						<br><br>
						As for what time fans can catch the anime’s latest, new episodes typically drop on streaming platforms Sunday afternoon. Here’s when episode 86 should show depending on each time zone:
						<ul>
							<li>PST: 12:45 p.m</li>
							<li>CST: 2:45 p.m</li>
							<li>EST: 3:45 p.m</li>
							<li>GMT: 7:45 p.m</li>
							<li>CET: 8:45 p.m</li>

						</ul>
						Now that you know when Attack on Titan Episode 86 arrives, where can you watch it? Following a broadcast in Japan, installments drop on Crunchyroll, Funimation, and Hulu. They all arrive at the times listed above, though occasionally there are delays depending on the streamer.
						<br><br>
						You’ll need a subscription to tune in no matter which platform you’re using. Hulu currently clocks in at $6.99 per month. Meanwhile, a premium Crunchyroll subscription starts at $7.99 per month and a premium Funimation one begins at $5.99 per month. <br><br>
						Wherever you’re watching, Attack on Titan Episode 86 promises to be another action-packed installment. It will also lead into the finale — and presumably, this outing’s climax.

					<h2>Attack on Titan Just Witnessed One of Its Darkest Kills</h2>

						Attack on Titan isn't the kind of show that hesitates to kill a character. From the day it started, the anime has killed some of its biggest leads, and many of its deaths have been gruesome to put nicely. Season four has ramped up that violence as the show's stakes are higher than ever. And this week, the show graced fans with one of its darkest kills to date. <br><br>
						After all, it is one thing to see Titans culling humans. It is a totally different thing to see humans turn on each other in this dystopian minefield. Attack on Titan gave one of its heroes the dishonor of committing murder, and it is as hard to watch as you'd expect.<br><br>
						In the end, the job falls to Connie as he and Armin try to keep the dock's boat in one piece. The pair manage to convince their former friends Daz and Samuel they are on their side. However, things take a turn when Armin is shot by Samuel, and the two Yeagerist bemoan the way they were betrayed.<br><br>
						Connie is unable to solve the situation peacefully, and when Armin begins to awaken from his injury, things take a turn. Our hero remembers some dark words from Bertholdt about bloodying his hands, and Connie shoots Daz moments later. He goes on to shoot Samuel several times, and Connie can only cry as he coats his hands in blood.<br><br>
						This is far from the first time Connie has seen death, but it is the most personal. The young soldier had to kill two former allies in order to stop Eren, but no amount of reasoning can absolve Connie from his actions. He has a firsthand understanding of why Reiner and Bertholdt turned on their comrades all those years ago. And no matter what happens with Eren, this is one mission Connie cannot come back from.

						"Attack on Titan episode 86 is the penultimate episode of the show's run. That's it. We're almost at the end. In preparation of the show's endgame, we've put together a quick guide on the Attack on Titan episode 86 release date and air time. That's perfect for those of you caught out by Daylight Savings last week. We know you're out there.
						<br><br>
						Plus, with the Crunchyroll merger now in full swing, there's going to be plenty of new users who are unfamiliar with the streaming service. Hello! And welcome. Join us as we get ahead of the game to avoid spoilers Floch-ing to our social media timelines. Here's all you need to know about the new Attack on Titan episode, otherwise known as Attack on Titan Final Season part 2, episode 11. Which is a mouthful.
						<br><br>
					 	The new episode's air time has changed. Because of Daylight Savings, "Retrospective" will be available on Crunchyroll an hour later than usual: from 1:45 PM Pacific/4:45 PM Eastern. It's 8:45 PM GMT as usual in the UK.
					 	English dubs are on the way too. They're around a month behind their subbed counterparts, so expect episode 86's English dub to drop in mid-April.
					 	<br><br>
					 	<h3>Attack on Titan Season 4 release schedule: how many episodes are left?</h3>
					 	<br>
					 	There is only one episode left after episode 86. That finale has been pushed back a week, however, to April 3. It's unknown if April's episode will be the last we ever see from Attack on Titan. With a lot of ground still left to cover, a movie could be a distinct possibility to wrap up Eren's story.
