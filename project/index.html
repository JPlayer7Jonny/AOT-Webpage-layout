								"That day, the human race remembered the terror of being dominated by them, and the shame of being held captive in a birdcage..."<br><br>
								Over than one century ago, a natural predator of humanity appeared: the Titans, humanoid beings of enormous size and apparently low intelligence but mindless monsters whose sole purpose of existence seemed to be to devour humans, only for pleasure. Humanity was rapidly exterminated, and not to much later, was nearly wiped out by the sudden appearance of those creatures. However, a small group of humans managed survived. They   responded by constructing three concentric walls: Wall Maria, Wall Rose and Wall Sina, extremely high wall which graced them with a century of peace. The remaining human cities had been proteced by those three walls since then. <br><br>
								For 107 years, the humanity watched the unsuccessful attacks by the Titans, who could not overcome the great wall. Util thatone day, young Eren Jaeger and his adopted sister, Mikasa Ackerman, witnessed the appearance of a titan taller than the wall, the Colossal Titan, who breached the outer wall, allowing the smaller Titans to invade the human territory and forcing the survivors to retreat to the inner walls. Both children witness the horror of seeing their mother being eaten alive by one of them. Since that day, Eren has sworn revenge on each of the Titans. <br><br>
								So the characters begin their journey, not only for their survival but also for their long-awaited freedom, both from the titans and the walls. Along with the characters, discover the mysteries and secrets of this world that manages to be wrapped in fantasy, and dipped in realism.
